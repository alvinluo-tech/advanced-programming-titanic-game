## Overview

This is the second escape challenge of the group project “The Temporal Rift on the Titanic”.

In this challenge, players must restore the correct chronological order of five passenger echoes using contextual and historical clues related to the Titanic’s voyage.

## Story Context

Ripples in time have distorted fragments of memory from the Titanic’s passengers.
Each fragment, or “echo”, reveals a moment from their journey from boarding to the final lifeboats.
To repair the timeline, players must analyze each echo and arrange them in their proper sequence.

## Challenge Description

Players are presented with five short narrative echoes (A–E) describing different passenger moments.
By interpreting linguistic and contextual cues, they must deduce when each event occurred in relation to the iceberg impact.

## How to Solve
	1.	Identify which echoes describe boarding events, those with “boarded at.”
These occur before the iceberg impact.
	2.	Use the boarding port order to determine sequence:
Southampton → Cherbourg → Queenstown.
	3.	Next, find the post-impact scene (deck tilting, panic).
This comes after all boarding events.
	4.	Finally, the lifeboat or escape scene always occurs last.
	5.	Combine all logic to find the final order: C → D → E → A → B.
