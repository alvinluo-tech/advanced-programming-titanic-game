### GM Guide

> **Hint:** GM Hint: Refer to the box plot above. The forged card has a fare that doesn't match its class - either much higher or much lower than typical for that class. Players should compare each card's fare with the distribution shown in the chart for that card's class.
> **Answer:** [[REVEAL_ANSWER]]The forged card: 2nd class (Pclass=2) but paying £82.71, which doesn't match typical 2nd class fares (£10.50-73.50). **(In this game, this card is Card 2)**[[END_REVEAL]]
> **Obtain:** **Temporal Coordinate Fragment 1** hidden under the forged card.

## Game End

Congratulations! You've collected all 4 coordinate fragments, restarted the time machine, and successfully escaped from 1912 at the moment the Titanic sank.
