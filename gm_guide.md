### GM Guide

> **Hint:** GM Hint: Refer to the box plot above. The forged card has a fare that doesn't match its class - either much higher or much lower than typical for that class. Players should compare each card's fare with the distribution shown in the chart for that card's class.
> **Answer:** [[REVEAL_ANSWER]]The forged card: 1st class (Pclass=1) but paying £8.59, which is much lower than typical 1st class fares (£5.00-512.33). **(In this game, this card is Card 5)**[[END_REVEAL]]
> **Obtain:** **Temporal Coordinate Fragment 1** hidden under the forged card.

## Game End
