# The Temporal Rift on the Titanic: GM Guide

**Player Role:** You are a team of time travelers.
**Final Goal:** Before the ship sinks, find 4 missing 'temporal coordinate fragments'.

## Challenge 1: Purser's Office (Find the Anomaly)

**Story:** You've just boarded and been caught as stowaways. On the desk is a stack of passenger registration cards. You must identify the 'forged' card among them.

**Task:** Out of the following 6 passenger cards, which one is statistically impossible?

### GM Guide

> **Hint:** GM Hint: Refer to the box plot above. The forged card has a fare that doesn't match its class - either much higher or much lower than typical for that class. Players should compare each card's fare with the distribution shown in the chart for that card's class.
> **Answer:** [[REVEAL_ANSWER]]The forged card: 1st class (Pclass=1) but paying £8.07, which is much lower than typical 1st class fares (£5.00-512.33). **(In this game, this card is Card 4)**[[END_REVEAL]]
> **Obtain:** **Temporal Coordinate Fragment 1** hidden under the forged card.

## Challenge 2: Echoes of the Passengers (Timeline Synchronization)

**Story:** Time ripples carry brief echoes of five travelers aboard the Titanic. Align their moments to restore the timeline.

**Known Facts**
- Boarding order by port: Southampton (S) → Cherbourg (C) → Queenstown (Q).
- Phrases like 'boarded at' are before the iceberg impact.
- Words like 'tilted', 'helping', or 'chaos' are after impact but still onboard.
- Mentions of 'escaped' or 'lifeboat' happen last.

### Echoes (Show to Players)

- Echo A: In the final chaos, Doling finds space in a lifeboat and slips into the night.
- Echo B: O'Leary boards at Queenstown (Q); a third-class ticket rustles in hand.
- Echo C: Lanterns sway as the deck tilts; Baxter steadies a stranger amid rising alarm.
- Echo D: Markoff boards at Cherbourg (C); a third-class ticket rustles in hand.
- Echo E: Lovell boards at Southampton (S); a third-class ticket rustles in hand.

**Task:** Arrange the echoes (A–E) in correct chronological order.

### GM Guide

> **Answer:** [[REVEAL_ANSWER]]Correct order: E, D, B, C, A. Boarding echoes come first and follow port order S → C → Q; post-impact echoes (tilted/helping/chaos) follow; the lifeboat escape is last.[[END_REVEAL]]
> **Obtain:** **Temporal Coordinate Fragment 2** revealed when the order is correct.

## Game End

Congratulations! You've collected all 4 coordinate fragments, restarted the time machine, and successfully escaped from 1912 at the moment the Titanic sank.
