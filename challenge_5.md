# Challenge 5: Identify the Saboteurs Game

  

Two time travelling imposters have taken the final temporal fragment and hidden it. A friend at time travelling HQ sent a transmission naming these imposters. However, the enemy time travellers have intercepted and warped the transmission. Now the transmission only includes cryptic hints to the imposter’s identities. Furthermore, the imposters have added hints to non-saboteur passengers. Your task has two parts.

  

## Part 1

  

Each message contains a hint to a passenger from a list presented to the player. There are four messages in total. These messages are generated by a LLM. The player must identify the passenger hinted at in each message.

  

Two real passenger names will be selected at random from a pre-determined list and input as prompts to generate the cryptic hints.

  

Furthermore, the LLM will generate an additional two cryptic hints with corresponding fake passenger names

  

Example hints and solutions:

  

· **Clue 1:** “She moves quietly through folded hours, stitching torn timelines with grace. Her touch repairs what the centuries unravel, though she herself remains a patch upon the fabric of memory.”

  

**Answer 1:** Rugg, Miss. Emily

  

· **Clue2:** “He pens the minutes like chapters, his words binding moments that refuse to stay still. Yet even he cannot edit the fate that writes itself between his lines.”

  

**Answer 2:** Novel, Mr. Mansouer

  

· **Clue 3**: “A gentleman who counts shadows instead of stars, claiming to chart constellations no one else can see. His maps lead only in circles, drawn with ink that fades before dawn.”

  

**Answer 3:** Cartwright, Mr. Silas

  

· **Clue 4:** “Her laughter rings like chime sat the edge of perception—sweet at first, then hollow. Those who follow her melody find themselves wandering through echo instead of song.”

  

**Answer 4:** Bellamy, Miss. Cora

  

If the player is struggling the LLM can provide additional cryptic messages pointing to the same names as hints. Once the player correctly identifies the four names move to part 2.

  

## Part 2

  

The enemy time-travellers have tampered with the Titanic passenger database! They forged data entries for the imposters, but in their haste, they entered anomalous family data values for siblings/spouses (sibsp) and parents/children (parch)

  

**Player Objective**

  

Use data visualisation to expose the fakes.

  

**What the Player Sees**

  

* A Seaborn box-and-whisker plot for both sibsp and parch.

  

* The passenger information displayed beneath or alongside the graphs.

  

**How to Solve**

  

* Compare each suspect’s family counts (sibsp, parch) with the rest of the Titanic passengers.

  

* Passengers whose values lie far outside the normal range (the outliers on the box plots) are likely to be the forged, fake records (the imposters).

  

* The others, whose data fall within typical ranges, are the real passengers.
